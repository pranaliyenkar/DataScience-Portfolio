# **Turning Raw Sales Data into Actionable Business Insights with Python**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Analyzed 12 months of electronics store sales data using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to uncover key business insights.  
After cleaning and preparing the dataset (removing missing values, fixing data types, and merging monthly CSVs), I explored questions such as the **best month for sales**, **top-selling cities**, **peak advertisement times**, and **products frequently bought together**.  
The analysis combined grouping, aggregation, and visualization techniques to reveal patterns in customer behavior, identify top-performing products, and suggest opportunities for marketing and inventory optimization.

## ðŸ›  Key Steps  

### **1. Data Cleaning**  
- Removed missing values and irrelevant rows  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types (`to_numeric`, `to_datetime`, `astype`)  
- Standardized formats and corrected errors for consistent analysis  

### **2. Data Exploration & Analysis**  
Explored and answered five main business questions:  
1. **Best month for sales** and total revenue in that month  
2. **City with the highest product sales**  
3. **Optimal time for advertisements** based on purchase patterns  
4. **Products most often sold together**  
5. **Top-selling product** and potential reasons for its performance
